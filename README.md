# 2020-08-04-springboot-jsp-database-study

A simple study of springboot. Created two simple jsp files to list "customers" from database and add data into database. Upon mvn clean install and docker-compose up, the project can be started immediately locally. 

Depending on the setup for docker-machine, if one is not using docker-toolbox then the URL of database connection is very likely not 192.168.99.100:3306, changes are needed. Database connection detail can be set in db.properties under resources directory.
